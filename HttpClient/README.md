# [HttpClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=net-9.0)

HttpClient works by establishing a connection over TCP to get a response from any server that serves web pages (or responds to HTTP requests).
It's pretty simple to use, but you need to use asynchronous code.
